# Using wrapture in tests

Bindings are ordinary objects with an explicit lifecycle, so they fit any
test framework's scoping tools without special integration. What matters
in a test suite is that every applied binding is removed again, whatever
the outcome of the test: a patch that leaks changes the behaviour of every
test that runs after it.

This page shows the scoping patterns for plain tests, pytest and unittest.
Everything here uses the monkey patching layer; the recording and
assertion workflow built on timelines is not implemented yet.

## Scoping with a context manager

The simplest pattern, and the right default for a patch needed in exactly
one test:

```python
def test_charge_is_stubbed():
    with wrapture.binding(Gateway, "charge").on_call.returns({"id": "stub"}):
        assert place_order("widget")["charge"] == "stub"
```

The patch is applied on entry and removed on exit, including when the test
body raises. Groups scope the same way:

```python
def test_gateway_offline():
    group = wrapture.bindings(charge=(Gateway, "charge"),
                              refund=(Gateway, "refund"))
    group.charge.on_call.raises(TimeoutError("down"))
    group.refund.on_call.raises(TimeoutError("down"))

    with group:
        ...
```

## Scoping with pytest fixtures

A yield fixture gives the same guarantee with reuse across tests:

```python
import pytest
import wrapture

@pytest.fixture
def stub_charge():
    with wrapture.binding(Gateway, "charge").on_call.returns({"id": "stub"}) as stub:
        yield stub

def test_order_uses_stub(stub_charge):
    assert place_order("widget")["charge"] == "stub"
```

Because the fixture yields the binding, a test can reconfigure it in
flight:

```python
def test_gateway_recovers(stub_charge):
    stub_charge.on_call.raises(TimeoutError("down"))
    with pytest.raises(TimeoutError):
        place_order("widget")

    stub_charge.on_call.returns({"id": "retry"})
    assert place_order("widget")["charge"] == "retry"
```

Keep fixtures that apply bindings **function scoped** (the pytest
default). A session or module scoped fixture leaves the patch applied
across every test in between, which reintroduces exactly the leakage the
fixture was meant to prevent; widen the scope only when that is the
intent.

## Scoping with unittest

Use `addCleanup()` rather than `tearDown()`, so removal is registered the
moment the patch is applied and runs even if a later line of `setUp()`
fails:

```python
import unittest
import wrapture

class OrderTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.charge = (
            wrapture.binding(Gateway, "charge")
            .on_call.returns({"id": "stub"})
            .apply()
        )
        self.addCleanup(self.charge.remove)

    def test_order_uses_stub(self):
        self.assertEqual(place_order("widget")["charge"], "stub")
```

`remove()` is idempotent, so a cleanup that runs after a test already
removed the binding is harmless.

## Sharing binding declarations

Creating a binding does not patch, so declarations can live at module or
class scope and be shared, with each test applying and removing as needed:

```python
charge = wrapture.binding(Gateway, "charge")

def test_one():
    with charge:
        ...

def test_two():
    with charge:
        ...
```

Two things to know when sharing a binding this way:

- **Behaviour persists across apply/remove cycles.** `remove()` restores
  the target but keeps the configured behaviour, so a stub configured in
  one test is still configured when the next test applies the same
  binding. Either configure behaviour in every test that needs it, or
  reset with `passes_through()`.
- **One application at a time.** A shared binding cannot be applied twice
  concurrently; the second `apply()` raises `AlreadyAppliedError`. This
  also means a shared binding is unsafe under parallel test runners such
  as pytest-xdist when two workers patch the same target in one process.

## Do not mix scoping styles

Pick one owner for each binding's lifecycle. Entering a binding as a
context manager when something else already applied it raises
`AlreadyAppliedError` rather than silently letting the inner scope remove
the outer scope's patch. If a fixture owns the binding, tests should only
reconfigure behaviour, never call `apply()`, `remove()` or enter it as a
context manager themselves.

## Verifying nothing leaked

For suite-wide insurance, an autouse fixture can assert the world was
restored:

```python
import wrapt

@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def no_leaked_patch():
    yield
    attr = vars(Gateway)["charge"]
    assert not issubclass(type(attr), wrapt.FunctionWrapper), (
        "a test left Gateway.charge patched"
    )
```

The check reads the raw class attribute with `vars()` and compares types
with `type()` rather than `isinstance()`, because a wrapt wrapper
masquerades as the object it wraps.

This is deliberately manual for now. A pytest plugin that sweeps for
bindings left applied at the end of each test is planned.
